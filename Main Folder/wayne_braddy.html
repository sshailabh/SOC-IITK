<h2>Real Men Get Depression</h2>

You’ll certainly be seeing a completely different side of funnyman Wayne Brady when he joins the cast of the smash Broadway hit Kinky Boots this November. Though winning the role of drag queen Lola — the lead character rocking the thigh high, red-sequined boots — is just the latest of this talented entertainer’s achievements, it’s by no means the most difficult challenge he’s faced.

In a video exclusive on People.com, Brady, who not long ago suffered a breakdown on his 42nd birthday, talked about his lifelong struggles with depression. One of the biggest problems with being a man who has depression, he says, is that it’s almost taboo to talk about it.

“What kind of man would I sound like if I told somebody, ‘Hey, I am so sad. I’m cripplingly sad. I can’t get out of bed. I just feel empty. Help me,’” he told People. “You feel like you need to cry or speak to someone about it, and, ‘Nope, I’m not gonna do that, because I’m a man,’” he said.
