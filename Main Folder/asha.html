The queen of shimmying hips and the pioneer of batwing eyelids, Asha Parekh is a versatile actor – the finest that India has produced. But the veteran actress who was on the top from 1959 to 1973 went through a phase where she was really depressed. The death of her parents, triggered the problems and pushed her into a dark zone.

According to PTI, Parekh once said, “It was a very bad phase for me. I lost my parents. I was totally alone and I had to manage everything all alone. It did put me in depression. I was feeling miserable and had these (suicidal) thoughts. Then I got out of it. It is a struggle, I had to take aid of the doctors to get out of it.”

Parekh feels that an actor may receive all the adoration and love from their fans but they can still feel lonely. In her words, “It is lonesome. On the top you are always lonely.”
