Long before her must-watch starring role in the ABC hit show Scandal, Kerry Washington was turning heads with her roles in movies like Ray and I Think I Love My Wife. But before those successes, she lived through dark days, suffering from what she described to Essence magazine in 2009 as an abusive relationship with food and exercise during her college years.

“I used food as a way to cope — it was my best friend,” she recalled. She’d eat until she sometimes passed out, then would head to the gym to exercise for hours on end. “Keeping my behavior secret was painful and isolating. There was a lot of guilt and shame,” she told the interviewer. Luckily, her dance teacher intervened, and Washington began years of therapy.

Recently, she joined forces with First Lady Michelle Obama and Sarah Jessica Parker to call attention to issues affecting veterans, including PTSD. “I think it’s really important to take the stigma away from mental health,” Washington told Glamour this past spring.
