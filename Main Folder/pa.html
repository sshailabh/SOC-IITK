<h2 align="center"> Parenting advices</h2>
    <h4>GIVE TIME TO YOUR CHILDREN:</h4>
     <span>Today parents have become very busy. Even in free time they like to spend it on phone. No interaction with  children leads to lonliness.
    </span>
	<h4>BE A FRIENDLY PARENT:</h4>
	<span>
    One's relationship with child should be such that your child is able to tell his feelings freely. The child should be as comfortable as if he is with his friend.
    </span>
	<h4>OVERALL ATMOSPHERE OF FAMILY:</h4>
	<span>
    It has been observed that atmosphere of family has direct effect on teenager's mental health. If parents fight very often or parents are themselves not able to cope a problem then child  also feels the pressure.
      </span>
	  <h4>HIGH EXPECTATION: </h4>
      <span>Today's era of high competition results in parents being obsessive of their children doing well. One should recognise the potential of thier children and set goal accordingly.Otherwise it creates stress and tension among teenagers to live up to the expectation.
