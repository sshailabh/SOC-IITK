The Padmavati actress created quite a stir when she came out in the open about her fight against depression at the pinnacle of her career.
</p>
<p>
At an event in New Delhi last year, Padukone recalled her experience, “I did not want to be in the situation I was. I wanted to come out of it desperately. As they say that every solution is within your own self, I found the strength within me and also the people I had around who made me believe that I can rely on them.”

She further added, “Two years back, my family had come to see me. They were about to leave and I was all alone in my bedroom, curled up. My mother walked in and asked if everything was okay, I said yes. She asked again if it was work or something else that was bothering me, I said no. She asked me so many times that I felt myself choking and I broke into tears….I want to tell my mother that if it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be here. Thank you for being with me all through the way. Thank you to my sister, my father and friends who supported my immensely.”

It’s remarkable how the actress emerged a winner. Today, she is an ardent supporter of mental health issues and doing her bit to help reduce the stigma related to mental illness. Her foundation ‘The Live, Love, Laugh Foundation’ aims at creating awareness about mental health issues in India and help others undergoing depression.
