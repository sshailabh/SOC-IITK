The Rustom actress has battled depression too. In an interview with MissMalini.com, Cruz accepted her condition and said, I think it's important for everybody to get themselves checked  mental health is something that's very important. Anxiety has been a big problem for me, but I think my biggest struggle has been depression. For me, my depression doesn't revolve around my work, it revolves around me personally. What's weird is that I'm not insecure about work, so when people ask me are you competitive? I say no. If someone's better than me, they're going to do better, it's as simple as that. If I'm good, I'll get successful to a certain extent. I believe you'll get to where you deserve.</p>

She further stated, The day I realized I have so much going wrong with me [was the most defining moment of my life]. I think the first part in really healing yourself is being aware that there's something really wrong in the first place. I'm glad Ia'm not one of those people who's in denial. I know there's something seriously wrong. I'm aware that I am flawed, I'm aware that I have issues, I'm aware that I need to be able to be healthy, not just physically but mentally. I know that I want to do something about it. I think that's the most  strangely  defining moment for me. Work is secondary, for me what's important is having a close-knit family and having someone you can call family. Someone you can actually be yourself with, because that's what's important at the end of the day money comes, money goes. It's not going to make you happy.</p>
