<h1>The Rock: Sharing a Message of Hope</h1>

Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, 43, recently shared a hopeful message to inspire others who may be dealing with depression.
</p><p>
"I found that, with depression, one of the most important things you could realize is that you're not alone," Johnson said during an episode of Oprah’s Master Class on the OWN network. "You're not the first to go through it; you're not going to be the last to go through it … I wish I had someone at that time who could just pull me aside and [say], 'Hey, it's gonna be okay. It'll be okay.' So I wish I knew that."

Johnson, the son of retired Canadian professional wrestler Rocky Johnson, experienced depression during his early twenties when his football career stalled. After graduating from the University of Miami, where he played as a backup defensive tackle for the Hurricanes, Johnson was passed over by the NFL. He then played for a Canadian football team, but was cut after two months. Johnson called this time of his life — during which he also lived in his parents’ basement — "a real low point."

He left his football dreams behind and instead focused on a new career: wrestling. And the rest is history. Today, The Rock has a laundry list of accomplishments under his belt, including New York Times bestselling author, family man, and action star in the popular movie franchise The Fast and the Furious. Still, he hopes that people with depression don’t give up hope during dark times.

"Hold on to that fundamental quality of faith," he said on Oprah's Master Class. "Have faith that on the other side of your pain is something good."
