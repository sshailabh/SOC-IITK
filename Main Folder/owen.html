<h1>Owen Wilson</h1>
 <h2>Thriving After a Suicide Attempt</h2>

His 2007 suicide attempt devastated his friends, family, and fans. Though Owen Wilson’s screen persona was that of a loopy, lovable surfer dude, offscreen he was a complex man who, as People reported at the time, has dealt with addiction issues and relationship problems, notably his then breakup with actor Kate Hudson. Though Wilson has been silent on his treatment, press interviews done around the time of his newest movie, No Escape, suggest that his two young sons have grounded him and bring him great joy — even as his own father is coping with Alzheimer’s disease.

Most of us have to deal with professional and personal issues at the same time, but stars like Wilson have the extra burden of doing this in the spotlight. “Some celebrities struggle to balance their public and private lives. Their self-esteem may not necessarily be built upon their authentic self, and so may be fragile and contingent upon continued fame,” says Pozios.
